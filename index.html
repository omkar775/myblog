        Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 5 years old. My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my friends in the back side of my home.
        My favorite cricket player is SachinTendulkar.
